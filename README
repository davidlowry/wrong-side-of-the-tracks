Wrong side of the tracks: Rails on Ubuntu

Sure its not a Mac, but Ubuntu does Rails too!
This is a quick and dirty script to get a working Ruby on Rails development environment up and working fast.
Its been tested on a default install of Ubuntu Karmic 9.10. 
Support for Lucid is on the way.
Since I maintain some older Rails apps the focus is on compatibility with many versions of Rails so Ruby 1.8.7 and MySQL 5.0 are used instead of the newer versions.

How to use it:

Run it like any other script:
Make sure you add execute permissions to it and then run it. Since it is installing stuff you will definitely need to use sudo to run it.

mike@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x wrongside
mike@ubuntu:~$ sudo ./wrongside
