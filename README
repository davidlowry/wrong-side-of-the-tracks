Wrong side of the tracks: Rails on Ubuntu

Sure its not a Mac, but Ubuntu does Rails too!
This is a quick and dirty script to get a complete working Ruby on Rails development environment up and working fast. Since I maintain some older Rails apps that development environment needs to support  many versions of Rails. I may end up using RVM for that but for the moment, using Ruby 1.8.7 and MySQL 5.0 seems to work for all versions.
Its been tested on a default install of Ubuntu Karmic 9.10 and the Alpha 3 of Lucid Lynx.

How to use it:

Run it like any other script:
Make sure you add execute permissions to it and then run it. Since it is installing stuff you will definitely need to use sudo to run it.

mike@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x wrong_side
mike@ubuntu:~$ sudo ./wrong_side
